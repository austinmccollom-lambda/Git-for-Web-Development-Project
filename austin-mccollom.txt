        Step 3: Add your TL as a collaborator on your forked Repo.
        Click Settings
        Add then click the Collaborators button
        Step 4: Clone your Repo using GitHubs ‘Clone or download’ butto
        Step 5: Back inside your CLI, use the **cd** command to go to the directory where you are going to want to clone your forked Repo (i.e. The location where the repo should be saved on your computer)
        Step 6: Use the **git clone **** command to clone the repo to the directory you are currently in.
        Step 7: **cd** into the newly created repo using the **cd **** command
        Step 8: Use the **git checkout -b ‘firstname-lastname’** command to create your own branch name for the repo (this is the branch that you will be doing your work on)
        Step 9: Now you can work on your repo and start getting the project assignment done.
        Step 10: To add and commit changes on your branch you can do the following
        Step 11: Push your changes back up to your Github repo
        Step 12: Now that the changes are on github you can submit a PR (Pull Request)
        Step 13: Go back to your forked Project repo on github (make sure you are on YOUR FORKED copy NOT the original Lambda one)
        Step 14: Add your TL to the **Reviewers** and then submit the pull request
        Step 15: DO NOT MERGE YOUR OWN PULL REQUEST
